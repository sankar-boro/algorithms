# Logarithm

- Logarithm, the exponent or power to which a base must be raised to yield a given number.
  Expressed mathematically, x is the logarithm of n to the base b if bx = n, in which case one writes x = logb n.
  For example, 23 = 8; therefore, 3 is the logarithm of 8 to base 2, or 3 = log2 8.
